## Inspiration

Due to the swift change to remote learning due to the Pandemic many students lost their sources of income. However remote learning still required students to have their materials to continue learning. We were inspired due to seeing that many of our peers can no longer afford the supplies they need for class. We didn’t want this to become a barrier to anyone's education. So we wanted to create Peer Share where students can support each other.

## What it does

This is an interactive application where students can select an area on the map and submit the item they would like to drop off along with the details about it(image & name). Along with the option to do a pick up of options listed at a location.
